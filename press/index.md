The _Atlas of Design_ Volume 3 is a 98-page collection of some of the World's most beautiful cartography. It covers all parts of the world, Mars, and imaginary places. The 12" x 9" landscape book is funded and produced by [NACIS](http://nacis.org/) and a small group of dedicated [volunteers](http://localhost:4000/about/staff/). The _Atlas_ has been featured in publications such as [National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/best-new-maps-atlas-design/), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/atlas-design-back-wonderfully-funky-maps/), and [Flowingdata](https://flowingdata.com/2012/10/25/insisting-on-beautiful-maps/).

If you are interested in featuring the Atlas in your blog or journal, please contact us at <strong>atlas@nacis.org</strong> for questions. We are happy to provide a low-resolution digital version of the book, as well as connect you with the artists and cartographers directly.
