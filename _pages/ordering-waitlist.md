The first printing of the <em>Atlas of Design</em> has sold out! However, we have ordered a second printing due to the demand. Sign up below if you'd like to buy a copy once more become available!

<strong>Please note that there are presently more people on the waitlist than there are available copies of the book. Â Being on the waitlist does not guarantee there will be any left to purchase when we release them for sale. Those who are on the waitlist will have the first chance to buy a copy before we release it for general sale (if any are left).</strong>
