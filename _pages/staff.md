The Atlas of Design is a product of the <a href="http://nacis.org">North American Cartographic Information Society</a>, and is prepared by a small, but enthusiastic staff of volunteers:
<h4>Editors</h4>
<strong>Sam Matthews</strong> is a 2015 Fellow at Code for America. He is a web developer and active proponent of open data. You can find him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/vancematthews">@vancematthews</a> or see him at <a href="http://mapsam.com">mapsam</a>.

<strong>Marty Elmer</strong> is a Minneapolis-based information designer, graphic artist, and mapping aficionado. His blog, <a href="http://www.maphugger.com">MapHugger</a>, is a cabinet of cartographic curiosities, celebrating the world's most artful, experimental, and unusual maps. You can find him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/maphugger">@maphugger</a>.
<h4>Assistant Editor</h4>
<strong>Ginny Mason </strong>is a cartographer and graphics editor at National Geographic Magazine. She likes maps that help people make informed decisions. You can follow her on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/masonginny" target="_blank">@masonginny</a>.
<h4>Past Editors</h4>
<strong>Daniel Huffman</strong> served as Editor for the first two volumes of the <em>Atlas</em>. Working alongside founder Tim Wallace, he helped develop the template for the project, and is enormously proud of what their initial ideas have become. A high point of his life was seeing his name listed in a library catalogue. You can find him at <a href="http://somethingaboutmaps.com">somethingaboutmaps.com</a>, or on Twitter at <a class="user-mention" href="https://github.com/pinakographos">@pinakographos</a>.

<strong>Tim Wallace</strong> was the first Editor of the <em>Atlas of Design</em>, serving from 2010–2013 and carrying the project from an initial idea to a beautiful finished volume. Though he is no longer involved in the project, our work today is still very much built upon his efforts, and the <em>Atlas of Design</em> remains enriched by the results of his hard work and vision. You can find him at <a href="http://timwallace.info">timwallace.info</a>, or on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/wallacetim">@wallacetim</a>.
