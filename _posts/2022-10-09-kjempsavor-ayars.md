Most maps are leveraged by the world they depict. Whether the map is of a fictional place or a real one, the story is illustrated by the map. The narrative we care about is elsewhere: the map is a guide and a support to our understanding.

David Nutall's work flips this basic mode of dealing with maps. There is no separate story. There is no actual world to reference. His maps are the fiction. They exist solely for themselves, and if the viewer sees a story emerging from them, that's on the viewer, not the creator. The maps are pure world-building. I find this exciting and fascinating.

David's maps do wear the sorts of stylistic suits of clothes "regular" referential maps use. They studiously use stylesheets from particular eras and schools of cartography. And the "places" mapped, like most historical fiction, has strong roots in actual geographies. The patterns of settlement and transportation, the way landforms relate to one another: David knows his stuff. And so this map, *"Kjempsavor Ayars,"* looks like the Faeroes... and the Shetlands, the Outer Hebrides, or the islands of Norway. And the map artwork looks a lot like a kind of map-making from the early mid-20th century, where old schools of hand-lettering and drafting met an ever-more-engineered modern world. But, and this is such a puzzle to know what to do with: It's not actually of anywhere. There's no stories to back you up about this bridge or that ferry route, the Viking history of that settlement or the modern fishing industry at that port. It suggests there ought to be a history like that, but it unexpectedly leaves you with that job.
