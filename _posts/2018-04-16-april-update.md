Map selection and pre-orders are in the works!

We know that the entrants are anxious to know whether their maps will be featured in Volume 4. We are in the process of determining the finalists. There are so many wonderful maps to choose from; it's a daunting task! Stay tuned! 

We are thrilled that many fans of the Atlas are clamoring to put in a pre-order. We want you to know that we are actively working to set up pre-orders as well.
