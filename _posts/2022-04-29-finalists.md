Greetings!

We are excited to announce the final selection of maps set to be featured in the Atlas of Design, Volume VI! As with past volumes, the amazing number and quality of maps you sent us made it a difficult task to choose just 32. This year, we had fewer entries than we had for Volume V, but the overall quality was higher, making it even harder to choose. We could’ve assembled multiple fantastic volumes from this year’s entries alone. Our sincere thanks to everyone who submitted, and we encourage you all to submit again next time!

Here are maps you’ll find in the Atlas of Design Volume VI:

We’d also like to recognize a group of honorable mentions. These maps were all in serious consideration for the final volume, but unfortunately, we can only include so many—our final selection was as much about balance and variety as it was about quality! You can read more about our general selection process again, [here](https://atlasofdesign.org/2014/11/05/judging-process/).

And lastly, we’d like to give a big thanks to our volunteer judges, who were willing to lend their time and cartographic expertise to the selection process. Their efforts help us to create the best Atlas we can. Our immense thanks goes to: Aly Ollivierre, Armelle Caron, Daniel Huffman, John Krygier, Jordan Engel, Juliane Cron, Kenneth Field, Madison Draper, Meghan Kelly, Tim Wallace, Tom Patterson, and Vicky Johnson.

So what’s next? The Editorial Team and this volume’s contributors will begin working on assembling layouts and crafting the commentary for each map. From there we hope to have a first draft layout for the book by July and files shipped to our press in August. At the moment, we are still on target for release during the NACIS Annual Meeting in October (see you in Minneapolis!).
