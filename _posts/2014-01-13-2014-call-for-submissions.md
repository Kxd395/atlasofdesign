Friends of the <em>Atlas</em>,

We're very excited to release the <a href="http://atlasofdesign.org/call">Call for Submissions</a> for the 2014 edition of the <em>Atlas of Design</em>! We want to build on the success of the <a href="http://atlasofdesign.org/one">2012 edition</a> and produce an even better volume the second time around. We hope you'll help us create a great showcase of maps by submitting your work, and by spreading the word around to other mapmakers!
