We had over 300 total entries for this year’s atlas, which is more than any previous volume!  With only 32 maps featured in the book, selecting the finalists has not been easy. After a long process of deliberation, we have selected the maps to be featured in the 2018 edition of the atlas. 

In alphabetical order by title, here are the 2018 finalists:
