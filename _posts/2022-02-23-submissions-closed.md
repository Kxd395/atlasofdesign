Hello map lovers,

We wanted to give you all a quick update on the status of Volume VI and our expected timeline moving forward. Our call for submissions closed on January 31 and we are absolutely thrilled with the incredible selection of maps that you shared with us. Thank you to everyone who threw their cartographic hats into the ring and to everyone who helped spread the word. The atlas is nothing without you.

Next up is the judging of entries – a process you can read more about in a previous blog post, [here](https://atlasofdesign.org/2014/11/05/judging-process/). The Editing Team has completed its initial pre-screening and has sent the submissions over to our judging panel for scoring. We hope to announce our Atlas contributors by early April, and are keeping things on track to ship Volume VI by the time of the [NACIS conference in Minneapolis in October](https://nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting/) (fingers crossed). Watch for the chance to preorder later this summer!
