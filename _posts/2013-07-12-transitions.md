Friends of the <em>Atlas</em>,

As preparations get under way for the 2014 edition of our project, we wanted to let you know that we've had some staffing changes here at AoD headquarters:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tim Wallace</strong> has decided to step away from his role as Editor of the <em>Atlas of Design</em>. He took this project on in its infancy and carried it from an idea to a beautiful finished volume. We are all enriched by the results of his hard work and vision, and we thank him heartily for all of his efforts in bringing the project this far.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Sam Matthews</strong>, formerly the project's Assistant Editor, has agreed to take on the role of Editor, joining Daniel Huffman as the co-head of the 2014 edition of the <em>Atlas</em>. Sam's enthusiasm, creative skills, and organizational abilities are already paying dividends, and we are very fortunate to have him aboard.</li>
<br>
	<li><strong>Marty Elmer</strong> joins us as our new Assistant Editor. An illustrator, cartographer, and all-around great designer, Marty brings a strong and thoughtful creative vision to the team. His skills are going to help us build a better <em>Atlas</em>, and we're excited to see what it will look like.</li>
</ul>
