Submissions for Volume 5 of the <em>Atlas of Design</em> are closed, and we have **over 450** entries. We are amazed by this response! 
We are now beginning to sort through the entries, preparing to turn them over to our panel of judges. 
If you are curious about the selection process, this blog post from 2014 outlines it nicely:
