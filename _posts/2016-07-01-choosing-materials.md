While we coordinate with our finalists and begin organizing the maps into their final arrangement we are working hard with our publisher to get quotes and materials finalized. The [American Printing Co.](http://www.americanprintingco.com/) out of Madison, Wisconsin has been our trusty publisher since the very first volume. We are thrilled to continue working with their team this year in preparation for the third volume.

We haven't fully decided what materials we'll be using for the third volume, but want to extend a big thanks to our Twitter followers for giving us some major insight.
