Greetings cartographers!

Four years have passed since the original call to be a part of the Atlas of Design, and we couldn't be more happy about the quality of maps coming through our organization. We have been hard at work the past year preparing ourselves for the creation of the <em>third</em> volume. A lot has happened: Daniel Huffman concluded his term with the team, Marty Elmer became Co-Editor, Ginny Mason from The National Geographic Society joined as Assistant Editor, we made some changes to the website, and chatted about some gorgeous maps in the second volume. It has all led to this ...

<strong>We beyond excited to announce the <em>Call for Submissions</em> for The Atlas of Design, Volume III</strong>! Submissions will be accepted until February 28th, 2016 - hopefully giving you plenty of time to add those finishing touches to those maps on the backburner, or talk to your bosses about including some of your work in the third edition.

If you're ready to submit, head over to atlasofdesign.org/submit and fill out the quick form and upload your map. If you'd like a reminder, you can sign up for email updates at the bottom of the website - we'll post mid-February with a reminder.
