We are excited to announce we will be changing fulfillment partners. [East View Map Link](http://www.evmaplink.com/) will be taking over all of our fulfillment needs, including shipping and handling, as well as warehousing. We're excited to be working with a company dedicated to distributing cartographic products all around the world.

Of course, changing fulfillment partners requires us to ship all of the Atlases to a new warehouse, which means **all of our sales are on hold starting today.** If you are planning on attending NACIS in Colorado Springs this year, stay tuned for Volume 3 orders to pick up on site! You'll also be able to order Volume 2 if you haven't already.

Sales will recommence in late October, 2016. Stay tuned!
