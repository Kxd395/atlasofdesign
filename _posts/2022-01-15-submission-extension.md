Hello map enthusiasts,

We wanted to let everyone know that we are still accepting submissions for Volume VI of the Atlas of Design and are hoping that we get a chance to see your work. And because the times are crazy, we wanted to make sure that everyone had enough time to get in their entries – and are extending our submission deadline until January 31st, 2022 11:59 PST. But don’t wait too long!

We also wanted to remind everyone that the Atlas is meant to be a global showcase – and that we love to receive maps from cartographers outside of NACIS and North America. There are no restrictions on subject matter, geography, or language. And if you want to send us a map of planet Qo'noS written entirely in Klingon, we’d love to see that, too.

Lastly, if you don’t have anything that you’d like to submit yourself this time, you can still give us a huge hand by spreading the word to your friends and colleagues. Getting the word out to other organizations and social circles will help us assemble the very best Atlas we can, showcasing the diversity of voices and ideas that the world of cartography has to offer.


We hope to see your work soon,

Nat, Tracy, Josh, & Aaron – Atlas of Design Editing Team
