Friendly mappers,

We're excited to announce the release of our new website (on our new website)! Much has been simmering since the first release of the <em>Atlas of Design</em>Â in October 2012. As you may be aware, our editorial team has <a title="Transitions" href="http://atlasofdesign.org/2013/07/12/transitions/">taken on a new look</a> with the inclusion of Sam Matthews and Marty Elmer as Editor and Assistant Editor, joined by the stalwart Daniel Huffman.

The past few months have proven to be challenging, as the Atlas moves toward the beginning of Volume II. Taking a look at the website we found ourselves struggling to provide deserved attribution for our Volume I authors while being able to focus on the upcoming edition. After many evenings of deliberation and procrastination we decided our previous website did not satisfy our needs moving forward.

With this, our new website was created. Now we are running a completely custom website that we can alter to our every need as we turn our focus on to future volumes. Creating the website, to be honest, has not been as challenging as most. How can it be with all these great maps?! Our content is completely driven by the beauty that was Volume I. Our subtle greyscale theme relies on the color and originality of the authors that made the first edition possible. Notice our newly-created <a title="Volume One" href="http://atlasofdesign.org/one/">Volume I contributor page</a>, which attributes every author and map in the first edition. Soon, we'll be announcing our Call for Submissions for the second volume, which will be completely integrated with our website to make it as easy as possible for you and your friends to submit your maps. Moving forward, this website will be host to some of the most inspiring maps around the world.

Thank you, everyone, for your continued support and interest in the <em>Atlas of Design</em>. Here's to a big next step!
