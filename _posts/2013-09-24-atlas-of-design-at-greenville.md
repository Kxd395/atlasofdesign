The <i>Atlas of Design </i>will be available for purchase at the <a href="http://nacis.org">NACIS</a> 2013 Annual Meeting in Greenville, SC! To make sure we don't sell out before you have a chance to grab a copy, <b>send an email to <a href="mailto:atlasofdesign@gmail.com" target="_blank">atlasofdesign@gmail.com</a> with your name and the number of copies you'd like</b>, and we'll reserve your order. By purchasing at the conference, you'll save on shipping costs, and NACIS members also receive 25% off the cover price (regular $35).

If you've never been to NACIS, we highly recommend it. It's a really fun time, with great people and great presentations on all aspects of mapping. We'll see you there.
