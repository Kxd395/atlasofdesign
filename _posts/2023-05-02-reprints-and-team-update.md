We’re also excited to announce that we’ve assembled a new team of editors and are already in the early planning stages for Volume 7. We hope to share more information with you this fall! In the meantime, let us introduce ourselves:
 
<strong>Aileen Clarke</strong> is a freelance cartographer and developer currently based in Madison, WI. She loves to make maps of Washington, DC, where she lived for six years. When she's not mapping, she enjoys collecting weird vintage cookbooks, taking walks to pet the neighborhood cats, and baking cookies to share with friends. You can find her at <a href="https://aileenclarke.github.io/">aileenclarke.com</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/_AileenClarke">@_AileenClarke</a>.
 
<strong>Daniel Coe</strong> is the graphics editor for the Washington Geological Survey in Olympia, Washington, where his work highlights the geomorphology and natural hazards of the region. When not making maps, he is usually out exploring the forests and waters of Washington with his family. You can find him at <a href="https://dancoecarto.com/">dancoecarto.com</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/geo_coe">@geo_coe</a>.

<strong>Erin Greb</strong> is a freelance cartographer, working with a variety of book publishers, and is also a contributing cartographer for Purple Lizard Maps. When not making maps of trails in the woods, she is out hiking or biking on them. You can find her at <a href="https://www.eringrebcartography.com/">www.eringrebcartography.com</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/eringrebmaps">@eringrebmaps</a>.

<strong>Aaron Koelker</strong>, returning editor from Volume 6, is a GIS specialist with the Florida Dept of Environmental Protection, where he gets to dabble with all sorts of spatial-related things. When not designing maps, he likes to take pictures or make things out of wood. You can find him at <a href="https://aaronkoelker.com/">aaronkoelker.com</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronKoelker">@AaronKoelker</a>.


In addition to the volume editors, we now have a new position on the team—the Series Managing Editor. The role of this position is to assist with continuity between volumes, production logistics, and to represent the Atlas of Design during NACIS Committee Board meetings. This will allow the editing team to focus primarily on creating the latest volume of the Atlas.
 
<strong>Nat Case</strong>, past editor from Volumes 5 and 6, will now be serving in the new Series Managing Editor role. Nat is a freelance cartographer in Minneapolis who has been making maps and managing publications since 1989. He is co-owner of INCase, LLC. He’s also a Morris dancer and organizes pub sings in the Twin Cities. He’s not on Twitter, but you can find him on Facebook, where he’s very active.
