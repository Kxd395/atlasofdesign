Their efforts help us to create the best Atlas we can. Our immense thanks goes to: Aly Ollivierre, Anton Thomas, Bill Limpisathian, Daniel Huffman, Delphine Papin, Jack Gieseking, Jim Meacham, Jennifer Mapes, Jug Cerovic, Julie Witmer, Molly O'Halloran, and Tim Wallace.

So what’s next? The Editorial Team and this volume’s contributors will begin working on assembling layouts and crafting the commentary for each map. From there we hope to have a first draft layout for the book by July and files shipped to our press in August. At the moment, we are still on target for release during the NACIS Annual Meeting in October (see you in Tacoma!).
