We enjoyed talking with people about the book, and were thrilled to meet many of the cartographers featured in the atlas. To see their delight when they thumbed through the Atlas and found their maps and essays was a great reward. Many of the atlas finalists presented on their work and methods at the conference as well.

The editorial team also presented on the behind-the scenes process of making the atlas, including a look at how entries are judged and how the book is produced. If you would like to view the talk, it will be available on YouTube in a few weeks.(LINK to NACIS Youtube)

We are thrilled to see the Atlas continue to serve as an ambassador for cartography. It continues to reach people far beyond our organization and from all over the world to help answer the question of what cartographers do by showing the breadth and depth of our profession. Weâ€™ve been retweeting folks who have been sharing their excitement on Twitter. Be sure to tag [@NACIS_Atlas](https://twitter.com/NACIS_Atlas) to share your thoughts on the atlas. 

Still need to order a copy? Thinking about ordering a copy as a gift for the holidays? We have a limited quantity remaining, so be sure to [order](http://atlasofdesign.org/order/) soon!

Also, remember that we are currently taking pre-orders for Volumes 1,2, and 3 of the atlas! If you would like to order previous volumes, fill out [this reprint form](http://atlasofdesign.org/reprints/).

Producing the Atlas was certainly a lot of work, but we are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with so many inspiring people! Thanks to all contributors and readers for making the Atlas of Design a reality.
