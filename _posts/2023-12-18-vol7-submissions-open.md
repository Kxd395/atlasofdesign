Hello map enthusiasts,

We wanted to remind everyone that we are accepting submissions for Volume VII of the Atlas of Design through January 21, 2024 at 11:59 PST. Don’t wait, submit soon!

The Atlas is meant to be a global showcase - we love to receive maps from cartographers outside of NACIS and North America. There are no restrictions on subject matter, geography, or language. 

If you don’t have anything you’d like to submit yourself this time, you can still help us out by spreading the word to your friends and colleagues. Getting the word out to other organizations and social circles will help us assemble the very best Atlas we can, showcasing the diversity of voices and ideas that the world of cartography has to offer.

We hope to see your work soon,

Aaron, Aileen, Dan, Erin, & Nat – Atlas of Design Editing Team
