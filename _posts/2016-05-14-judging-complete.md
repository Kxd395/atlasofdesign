After opening our third call for submissions in January this year, we and the judging committee reviewed nearly 250 maps. We put them side-by-side and analyzed each and every one, seaking out those maps that shined in aesthetic, art appeal, data curation, and everything in between.

Our judges this year:

| Name | Affiliation |
|------|-------------|
| AJ Ashton | Mapbox |
| Alethea Steingisser | InfoGraphics Lab, University of Oregon |
| Andy Woodruff | Axis Maps |
| Daniel Huffman | somethingaboutmaps |
| Hans van der Maarel | Red Geographics |
| Ian Muelenhaus | University of Wisconsin-Madison |
| Margaret Pearce | University of Kansas |
| Nat Case | Incase, LLC |
| Rob Roth | University of Wisconsin-Madison |
| Tanya Buckingham | University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison |
| Tim Wallace | New York Times |
| Tom Patterson | National Park Service |

The judging process, which [followed the same outline as the previous volume](/2014/11/05/954/), took place over the month of April and leaked into May. Thursday last week we emailed all submitters with the final results.

Soon we will introduce our finalists and honorable mentions. Stay tuned!
