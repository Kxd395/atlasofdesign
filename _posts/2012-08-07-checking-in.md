Hey everyone! Sorry for going quiet for so long, but we've been so busy working on creating the <em>Atlas of Design</em> that we haven't had a lot of time to actually tell you all about what we've been up to. Things have been going very well in the meantime, though, and we wanted to take a moment to give you a quick update.

Over the last couple of months, we've selected a press to print the final volume, decided on dimensions and other specs for how the book will be constructed, and collected high-res artwork from our finalists. Right now we're working on the final revisions to the layout of the book -- figuring out what goes where, and how it will look. We're also doing some final edits to all the text in the book, including commentaries written by each of the authors discussing their work. Once we get copyright releases from all of our authors, we're hoping to share some images with you.
<div>In about a month, we're expecting to deliver files to the press. At that point, most of our work as editors is done, and we'll be updating this site much more frequently in the run-up to the book's release, slated for mid-October at the <a href="http://www.nacis.org/index.cfm?x=2">NACIS Annual Meeting</a> in Portland.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hope you're excited for this as we are!</div>
