The <em>Atlas of Design</em> is a publication of the <a href="http://nacis.org">North American Cartographic Information Society</a>, an organization of mapping professionals in academia, government, and the private sector. The Atlas of Design project is headed up by two NACIS members, Tim Wallace and Daniel Huffman.

<strong>Tim Wallace</strong> is a Graphics Editor at The New York Times and a Ph.D. candidate at The University of Wisconsin-Madison. He's interested in cartographic design and interaction in news media. He is also a gummi bear enthusiast. You can find him at <a href="http://timwallace.info">timwallace.info</a>, or on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/wallacetim">@wallacetim</a>. He also serves as one of the two principles of the popular <a href="http://bostonography.com">Bostonography</a>, along with Andy Woodruff and is a co-organizer for Practical Cartography Day at NACIS 2012 in Portland (yes, he hopes to see you there!).

<strong>Daniel Huffman</strong> is a freelance cartographic designer and the proud owner of the imaginatively-named domain <a href="http://somethingaboutmaps.com">somethingaboutmaps.com</a>. You can find him on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/pinakographos">@pinakographos</a>, or read <a href="http://cartastrophe.wordpress.com">one</a> of his <a href="http://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com">two</a> blogs. He hopes to someday invent the profession "map critic."
