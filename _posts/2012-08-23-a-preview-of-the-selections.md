You may notice that several people involved in putting the <em>Atlas</em> together, including the editors, are featured in its pages. The judges and editors involved in making the final selections recused themselves where appropriate, both in passing judgment on their own work, and in evaluating that of close colleagues. The world of professional cartographers is a fairly small one, and a lot of people know each other. But we've tried to ensure that the process is as fair as any involving subjective aesthetic judgments can be. Not everyone will agree with all of our final selections, but we hope they will find our process sensible.
