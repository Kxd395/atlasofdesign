Submissions for Volume 4 of the <em>Atlas of Design</em> are now closed. We have over 300 entries! That's more than we've received for any previous volume. A huge thanks goes out to all who shared our call for participation, whether you posted it on social media, sent it to a friend, a student, or a colleague, or encouraged a cartographer to submit a particular piece. We are now preparing to turn things over to our panel of judges as we begin to make our selections for Volume 4. <br>
Thank you to all who contributed -- you make this atlas the beautiful and fascinating publication that it is!
