### We’re pleased to announce that pre-orders for Atlas of Design Volume 7 are now live!

Volume 7 contains 33(ish) maps along with author commentaries, as well as an introduction by our own Nat Case. Orders are expected to ship in October 2024 but in the meantime, you can get a sneak peak of the maps on the [Volume 7 page](http://atlasofdesign.org/seven). There are pre-order options both to have it shipped to your home, as well as an in-person pickup option for the NACIS Annual Meeting in Tacoma, WA later this year. Choose this latter option if you are attending the meeting and would like to pick up your copy in-person to avoid shipping fees. (Note: We’ll only have Volume 7 on hand in Tacoma. If you’d like to purchase previous volumes, please do so separately so they can be shipped to you directly. Likewise, if you pre-order Volume 7 for home-shipping along with any orders for past volumes, everything in the order will ship together once Volume 7 is released.)

Both pre-order options for Volume 7 can be found on our [Big Cartel webstore](https://atlasofdesign.bigcartel.com/products). NACIS Members, remember to apply your member discount code! You can find the code by logging in to your NACIS account on this [page](https://nacis.org/initiatives/atlas-of-design/atlas-member-discount-code/).  

We’re also excited to announce that you can now find all previous volumes of the Atlas of Design on Amazon, in addition to our Big Cartel webstore. We’ve done this to provide readers more options and expand our visibility. For [institutional purchases](https://atlasofdesign.bigcartel.com/tax-exempt), all volumes are also still available from East View. Please note, however, that pre-orders for Volume 7 can only be done through our Big Cartel webstore. It will be available to purchase directly from Amazon and East View after its release in October 2024. 

As always, thank you for your support. We can’t wait for you to see what’s in this next volume!

The Editors:
Aileen, Dan, Erin, Aaron
