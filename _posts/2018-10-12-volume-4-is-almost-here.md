Volume 4 is *almost* here! The books are currently being sewn and cased-in at the bindery, and should be finished and returned to the press in the next week or two. The first available books will ship out to our <a href="http://nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting/" target="_blank">NACIS annual meeting</a> in Norfolk, where NACIS attendees will be the first to pick up their copies! 

The rest of the books will be sent to our fulfillment center in Minneapolis by the end of October, to be packaged and shipped. I really hope they are mailed out by the end of October, but it could be the first half of November as far as I know at the moment. 

Thank you to all buyers for supporting the Atlas! We have exceeded all expectations of sales, and are getting close to selling out!
