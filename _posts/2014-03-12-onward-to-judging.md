The Call for Submissions for the 2014 edition of the <em>Atlas of Design</em> ended last week. In total, we received <strong>nearly 300</strong> submissions, handily outpacing the number received for the first <em>Atlas</em>. The diversity and quality of the maps submitted astounded all of us. A very sincere thank you to everyone who submitted their maps, or helped promote submissions; you make the <em>Atlas </em>the fantastic publication that it is!

Deciding which maps to publish will not be an easy task. Fortunately, we have assembled an all-star team of experts who have volunteered their time and expertise to judge the submissions. They come from a variety of backgrounds: professors, graphics editors, professional designers, and more: it is that diverse carto-savvy that we'll be relying on to complete the challenging task of curating the maps for this upcoming edition.

For those who submitted, we are still expecting to have all decisions finalized by <strong>May 1</strong>. In the meantime, meet the judges:
