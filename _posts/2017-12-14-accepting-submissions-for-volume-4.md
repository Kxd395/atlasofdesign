We are currently accepting map submissions for Volume 4, the 2018 Edition of the <em>Atlas of Design</em>! Submissions will be accepted until February 4, 2018. To review the submission guidelines and to enter your work, please visit the submission page at <a href='atlasofdesign.org/submit'>atlasofdesign.org/submit</a>. 

We extended the submission period from previous years to encourage you to dust off an almost-complete project and finish it up for submission.

As you submit your maps, you have the opportunity to add an explanation. While we don’t require this, you may consider this a chance to briefly state what makes your design a must-include for Volume 4. 

If you’d like another reminder, you can sign up for email updates at the bottom of the website - we’ll post another blog post mid-January. 

If you have any additional questions please email atlas@nacis.org.

We look forward to seeing your maps!
