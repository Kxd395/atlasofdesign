Did you miss out on a previous volume of the Atlas of Design? Now’s your chance to complete your collection! We’re ready to offer reprints of Volumes 1, 2, and 3 if enough people are interested.

<em>We need a minimum number of orders to be able to commit to a reprint.</em> So, here’s how it works: click on the buttons below to order your copies of each volume. Your credit card will not be charged until we meet our target, at which point we’ll let you know that the reprint is going ahead. If we don’t get enough orders, your order will be canceled and you won’t be charged anything.

Think of it as our own version of Kickstarter: no one pays anything until we know there’s enough interest to move forward. With your help, we can get these great collections of beautiful maps into new homes, many of whom have been waiting for years to have a chance to own one.
