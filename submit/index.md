Although our atlas is a static format—a printed book—we do accept web-based map entries. We have featured digital maps in past editions, including Eleanor Lutz's  web map style "Digital Woodcut" in [Volume II](http://atlasofdesign.org/two), Amy Lee Walton's "Whaam!" in [Volume III](http://atlasofdesign.org/three), and the interactive application "Find a Room—University of South Wales" by Barry Richards in [Volume II](http://atlasofdesign.org/two).
