Submissions for Volume IV of the *Atlas of Design* will open on October 10, 2017 during the <a href="http://nacis.org">NACIS</a> annual meeting in Montréal, Québec. We look forward to seeing your maps! 

### Submission Guidelines:

- Entries will be accepted through February 4, 2018
- You may enter no more than 3 maps
- The map should have been completed within the last 5 years
- If your map is selected for the book, you will be required to write a short essay discussing it
- If your map is selected for the book, you must give us permission to publish it 


You will be asked to submit your map as an image file (.jpg, .tif, .png, or .pdf), with the option to also include a website link. 

Although our atlas is a static format—a printed book—we do accept web-based map entries. We featured Eleanor Lutz's  web map style "Digital Woodcut" in [Volume II](http://atlasofdesign.org/two) and Amy Lee Walton's "Whaam!" in [Volume III](http://atlasofdesign.org/three). We also featured the interactive application "Find a Room—University of South Wales" by Barry Richards in [Volume II](http://atlasofdesign.org/two).
